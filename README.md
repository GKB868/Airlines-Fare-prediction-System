## Introduction
The Airline Fare Prediction project aims to predict the fare of airline tickets based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, source, destination, and other relevant factors. This can help passengers plan their travel budget and airlines to adjust their pricing strategies.

## Project Overview
This project involves several steps including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We utilize machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that can accurately forecast airline fares.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project includes information on:
- Date of Journey
- Source
- Destination
- Route
- Departure Time
- Arrival Time
- Duration
- Total Stops
- Airline
- Additional Information
- Price (Target Variable)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airline-fare-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd airline-fare-prediction
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `airline_fare_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.

## Model Training
The model training involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might help in improving the model's performance.
3. Model Selection: Trying different algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters for the models.
5. Training: Training the final model on the entire training dataset.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

We also visualize the performance using plots to understand the model's behavior.
